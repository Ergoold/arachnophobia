# Arachnophobia
Arachnophobia is a Minecraft mod that prevents spiders and cave spiders from spawning in-game. 

## Who is this mod for?
Arachnophobia was originally made because I suffer from arachnophobia and could not such finctionality on the latest version of the game, but this mod is for anyone who would like to use it for any reason. 

## What does this mod do, exactly?
Arachnophobia completely prevents the `spider` and `cave-spider` entities from spawning into your Minecraft world. 
It also makes string craftable with wool and makes zombies occasionally drop spider-eyes. 

Arachnophobia does *not* do any of the following: 
 - It does not prevent spider and cave-spider spawner blocks from generating; 
 - It does not remove any existing spider or cave-spider entities from the world; 
 - It does not remove any spider and cave-spider related items from the game (string, spider-eye, spider and cave-spider spawn eggs [1], and anything that is crafted using them). 

[1] spider and cave-spider spawn eggs still exist as items in the game, but will not be able to spawn spiders or cave-spiders, respectively.
